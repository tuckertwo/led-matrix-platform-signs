# Dimensions
The signs occupy a 20cm×60cm×23cm (L×W×H) volume exclusive of cables and
antennae and a 26cm×60cm×29cm volume when including cables and antennae.
The display area itself is 44cm×7cm.

# Mounting
The signs have a row of 5 #10-32 screw holes along the top and bottom edges.
This seems to be the best and only way of securely mounting the signs to a hard
surface.

# Triangle locks
The sign uses a pair of 9mm quarter-turn triangle locks to secure the outer
housing cover.
The [Universal Switchgear Cabinet Key](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:45994)
on Thingiverse should fit the locks, but I've not been able to test it.
Practical experience shows that pliers should be able to operate the locks as
well.
