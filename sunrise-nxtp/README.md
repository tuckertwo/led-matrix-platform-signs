# Sunrise Systems NXTPS series
These signs were originally used by SF Muni as next stop announcement signs on
the interior of their buses and light rail vehicles (specifically the LRV2/3
class manufactured by Breda; the Boeing SLRV/LRV1 was retired before these were
put into service and the Siemens S200/LRV4 uses a different type of display).
In service, these would have been driven by the OrbStar units that also provide
automated announcements, computer-aided dispatching (CAD), and automatic vehicle
location (AVL).

These units are fairly easy for a hobbyist or preservationist to use:
they take 6-60 VDC power and use a RS-485-based interface that is both simple
and reliable.
Public documentation is plentiful and the manufacturer (originally Sunrise
Systems, now [Sunrise SSEA Tech](https://www.sunrisesesatech.com/)) seems like
it might be responsive to inquiries for documentation.
As it is, the best available documentation of the protocol in use by the NXTPS
series comes in the form of a
[user manual for the NXTP series](https://forum.arduino.cc/uploads/short-url/xRmk8Crqg6jDzcJVLwyJlv8HTPV.pdf);
aside from documentation on some I/O pins present on the NXTPS series but not
the NXTP series, it offers an essentially complete description of the protocol
in use.
There is also a
[NXTPS Datasheet](https://cdn-docs.av-iq.com/dataSheet/NXTPS-Series_Datasheet.pdf)
available.
